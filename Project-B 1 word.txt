Employee Management ProjectGoalRequirementsCodingTeamsFeaturesFor EmployeesFor HRNoteGood PracticesSubmissionGoalWe want to create an employee/HR website portal for managing the new employee onboarding process. Employees will be able to update personal information, upload required documents for identification and work authorization. HR will be able to access employee information and make changes regarding the onboarding status.RequirementsCodingBackend: Node.js Express serverFrontend: React, Redux, React-redux, Typescript (optional)1+ UI component libraries (MUI, react-bootstrap, ant design, …)Any React form library (formik, react hook form, react final form,...)Optional: data visualization libraryYour project must make use of reusable components, at least for the sections on the employee personal information page Database: MongoDB, MongooseTeams1. Leads will be in charge of deciding on the project design (UI, organizing the project file structure), assigning workloads, and making sure everything progresses smoothly.2. Set up your team’s Github repository and add Alex as collaborator3. The Git repository should follow best practices regarding branches, commits, merging, pull requests, etc.FeaturesEmployeesHRLogin / NavigationLogin / NavigationRegistrationEmployee ProfilesOnboarding ApplicationVisa Status ManagementPersonal InformationHiring ManagementVisa Status ManagementFor Employees1. Registration pagea. An HR representative must generate a registration token and a link to the registration page, then send it to a new employee’s email. This is the only way for new employees to access the registration page.i. It should be able to send an actual email message to a valid email address. Here are some options for sending emails: emailjs, nodemailerb. Users must provide a unique username, password, and unique email (doesn’t need to be real, but should follow the email format like prefix@domain).2. Login pagea. Users should provide their username and password to log in, after which they are redirected to the Personal Information page.b. If they are not logged in, they only have access to the login page.c.

Users can only upload the next document after the previous document has been approved by HR.i. OPT Receipt (submitted in onboarding application, waiting for approval)1. If pending, there should be a message “Waiting for HR to approve your OPT Receipt”.2. If approved, there should be a message “Please upload a copy of your OPT EAD”.3.

Please focus on implementing the correct functionality to avoid spending too much time on styling. We recommend starting the project in this order:Data modeling (entities, relationships, schemas)Set up the MVC-based backend structureTo implement each page or feature, start with backend routing and then connect it to the frontend for that page or feature.Good Practices1. Pay attention to user authorization and input validation (client & server-side).a. Users should not be able to access other users’ profiles, documents, etc.b. Handle page navigation via directly typing in the url vs. clicking redirect links on the page.Submission1. You do not need to submit anything anywhere or record a video demo. The “deadline” is the day of the demo, when you are presenting your project.2. For the presentation, your slides should cover the following topics:a. Tech stack (what third-party libraries & services were used on the frontend and backend?)b. Frontend architecture (file structure)c. Backend architecture (file structure)d. Data modeling (models, relationships)e. Feature list (implemented, not implemented)i. Which features did you struggle on, and specifically what part of the implementation?ii. When talking about the remaining unfinished features, talk about how you would approach those implementations on a high level.f. Work Contributions (who did what)g. Demo Outline: (the workflow for onboarding & visa status management, from both the employee and HR perspective) i. Registration (generate & send token, navigate to signup page) ii. Onboarding Applicationiii. HR Hiring Management (Emails, Onboarding Feedback, Approval, &    Rejection) iv. Employee Visa Management (Upload & Download) v.
